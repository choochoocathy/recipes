2 pieces of whole wheat, multi-grain, or oatmeal bread
natural peanut butter (the kind you have to stir)
strawberry preserves (the kind with seeds and chunks of strawberries)

Toast the two pieces of bread. Slather one with peanut butter, the other with jelly, and serve in tupperware up to eight hours later.
